# Stardew Valley Animation Cancelling for macOS

## Before running

Add this application to System Settings -> Privacy & Security -> Accessibility, as it requires control behaviour of input devices.

## How to use

1. Middle mouse (scrollwheel, or "button 3") click will perform a left mouse button click, followed by a 200ms pause, then the animiation cancel routine (R + RightShift + Delete).
2. Holding the middle mouse down will re-trigger the behaviour repeatedly (left click, 200ms pause, R + RightShift + Delete) until it is released.

### Future development

- If required or desired, I will implement user-assigned triggers allowing the selection of a different mouse button or keyboard trigger.
- There's possibly also a future improvement to specify the pause duration between the animation cancel routine firing.

PR's welcomed.
